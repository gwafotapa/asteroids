# Asteroids

A Rust implementation using the bevy engine of a small game reminiscent of the old shoot'em up.

### Prerequisites

You need Rust and Cargo installed. See:
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html>

### Installing

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, execute:

```
cargo build --release
```

This compiles the binary `target/release/asteroids` you can then run with cargo:

```
cargo run --release
```
